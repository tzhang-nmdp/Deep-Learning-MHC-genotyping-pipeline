MHC (HLA/KIR) are highly polymorphic and homologous genomic regions, which are very challenging even with longread sequencing. 
Aims:
[1] contig_simulator
[2] sematic weight matrix for prior knowledge implementation
[3] MSA presentation / haplotype (pair) presentation as Alphafold2
[4] deep neuronal network with restnet + transformer
